an object is a collection of key-value pairs

like arrays, objects store values, but instead of storing them in numeric "indices", objects store values in string "keys"

/* 
an array is a good place to hold an ordered list of values, but it doesn't store any information about what those values represent
 */

/* 

an object's string keys allows objects to store more information about the values within it

/*
  Look at that! It makes so much more sense now

  If only zoo inventory had used objects! Can you imagine what it would have looked like?

  const animal = {
    name: "Simba",
    species: "Lion King",
    age: 7,
  }

  Play around with this later!

  if both object and arrays return a typeof "object", then how do we know if it's actually an object or if it's actually an array??
